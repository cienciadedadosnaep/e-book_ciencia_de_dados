abstract = {Many countries all over the world are in the process of introducing programming in their K-9 curricula. Due to recent changes in the Finnish curriculum there is a large need to train teachers in teaching programming at primary school level. In this paper, we describe how an online course was organized for elementary school teachers in Finland to learn how to teach programming using the Racket language. We introduce the content and design decisions behind the course and describe how the given feedback was used to develop the course further. Finally, we discuss some ideas for further investigations.},

abstract = {Bringing Programming to K-12 Education has been a strong tendency in Brazil and in the world. In this workin-progress, we describe an experience in teacher training with the goal of promoting the practice of programming and the development of computational thinking in students of Brazilian public schools, through an initiative called Programming Literacy. Here we present strategies used in the implementation of the initiative, design of a curricular structure and training program, as well as monitoring and evaluation strategies. The results and findings of the initiative, involving more than 500 students from four cities in 2016, are shared as well as the perspectives on next steps.},

@article{Williams2020,
abstract = {Digital technology is compulsory in schools in most states at most year levels in Australia. However, a recent survey of over 400 Australian schools in 2019 found that 96{\%} have had difficulty hiring qualified technology teachers and 39{\%} of schools have reduced the amount of technology education they offer. We have observed that there is a shortage of teachers who feel qualified to teach coding. To address this problem, we launched CS in Schools (see https://csinschools.com), a successful in-class professional development programme for teachers that helps schools build a robust digital technology capability in their students. Our programme matches pedagogy with content expertise, by matching a volunteer computing professional with a secondary school teacher, and helping that teacher develop their coding skills in the classroom over a six month period. This experience paper describes the approach we took in piloting our programme with 10 teachers inâˆ¼8 schools who taught over 1,100 students in 2019. We also describe our current scale-up in 2020 to work with around 60 teachers, around 40 volunteers, over 25 schools, and more than 6,000 students. Our goal is to work with hundreds of schools in 2021.},
